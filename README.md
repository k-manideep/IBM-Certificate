## I Believe :
- **Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.**
- **Success is the sum of small efforts - repeated day in and day out.**
- **Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.**
